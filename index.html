    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <img src="./assets/Display Picture.jpg" height = 300/>
    <p>Welcome! I'm a passionate computer vision engineer. Previously I was part of Machine Learning Research at Foundry and before that I led the Computer Vision AI Development at a London-based pre-seed startup. With a deep appreciation for all things related to Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and MLOps, I invite you to explore a glimpse of my journey.</p>
    <h1>Education</h1>

    <h2>University of Surrey</h2>
    <p>Msc. Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning</p>
    <p>2020-2021</p>
    
    <h2>Symbiosis Insitute of Technology</h2>
    <p>B.Tech Information technology</p>
    <p>2014-2018</p>

    <h1>Work Experience</h1>

        <h2>Foundry</h2>
            <p>Research on 3D Face Reconstruction from images and videos to streamline facial visual effects editing for movie production. Validated the research and
        established a clear pathway for production.</p>

        <h2>Brarista</h2>
            <p>After completing my Masters in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning, I became a part of Brarista. The journey has been truly remarkable. The opportunity to develop a CV-based solution alongside only two other CV engineers (including the CTO) has been incredibly fulfilling due to the strong sense of ownership and the weight of responsibilities involved.</p>

            <p>During my time at Brarista, I excelled in managing deep learning models using advanced technologies and developed a PyTorch-based library for streamlined model training. My work here improved product accuracy and played a pivotal role in maintaining the core software engine. I implemented distributed microservices for optimized resource utilization and designed scaling logic for fluctuating user traffic. It was a rewarding experience filled with impactful contributions.</p>
        <h2>Ernst & Young</h2>
            <p>During my tenure in the Data Science Team of EY's Forensic and Integrity Services Department, I had the opportunity to contribute to a diverse array of projects with a focus on fraud detection for our clients. From delving into Computer Vision tasks such as Face Recognition and Expression Recognition, to applying Natural Language Processing techniques like Entity Extraction and Tone Detection, and even developing Web Applications for automating the extraction of unstructured data into structured formats, I was involved in a wide range of impactful work. My dedication and exceptional performance in client projects were acknowledged with the prestigious Kudos Award, recognizing my unwavering commitment and outstanding results.</p>

        <h2>Axelta Systems</h2>
                <p>During my initial foray into the software engineering industry, I had the valuable opportunity to intern at Axelta Systems, an IoT company focused on services and education, located in Hyderabad. This experience allowed me to gain proficiency in visualizing real-time sensor data using d3.js and developing Android applications for real-time data visualization. It was during this internship that I first experienced a sense of accomplishment and the ability to contribute value to the world.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Text Talk</h2>
    <p>A reading web app integrated with LLMs for enhanced reading experience. Currently, integrating web search and improving the user interface.</p>
